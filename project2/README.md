# The Programming Assignment
Write a program that creates four processes that increment a shared memory segment with targets of 10000, 20000, 30000, and 50000 respectively. The shared memory segment must be protected using semaphores, and when then program terminates, the shared memory variable must have a value of 110000. 

# How to Compile the Program
1. go to file location
2. type "gcc semaphores.c -o semaphores" into the terminal (without quotation marks)
3. type "./semaphores" into the terminal (without quotation marks)
4. run it several times and observe.
5. yay!!
